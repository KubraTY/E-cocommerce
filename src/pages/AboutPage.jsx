          <strong>Kubra Tokgozlu</strong> I'm a Turkish native with a background in mathematics. Transitioning to IT, I've found excitement in problem-solving and coding. Family time is my greatest joy, and come summer, you'll catch me swimming in the Mediterranean. Join me in this journey where family, IT challenges, and seaside adventures intertwine.

          <strong>Victor Silva</strong> I was born in Brazil but came to Portugal when I was five years old, since then I have lived in Lisbon. I have a background in Management, but I have always been interested in technology, which is why I decided not to pursue the area of ​​economics. I really like playing football and playing computer games.
